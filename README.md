**Project Overview

**This project analyzes the US Road Accidents dataset to predict accident severity. By leveraging data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning, the goal is to build a model that identifies key factors contributing to accident severity and provides actionable insights to improve road safety.

**Features**

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights

Feature Engineering to enhance predictive 

Machine Learning Model to predict Accident Severity

Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

**Recommendations based on findings**

Dataset
The dataset contains information about traffic accidents in the United States, including:

Weather conditions
Road conditions
Severity levels
Accident times and other critical details.

**Process Workflow**
Data Preparation
Handle missing values and outliers.
Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis
Analyze accident severity distribution and contributing factors.
Feature Engineering
Create time-based features and select relevant columns.
Model Development
Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
Split data into training (75%), validation (15%), and testing (10%) sets.
Evaluation
Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy and ROC-AUC.
Recommendations
Suggest data-driven strategies to mitigate accidents.
